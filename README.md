## Where the assets came from 
the ship model for the tachi and donnager came from sketchfab, while the drones and catwalks were from the unity store.
The sound were taken from the website freesounds.
everything else (effects models etc) was made by me.
## What i used to make level
I used triggers that would activate the next scene once a certain point was reached. the cinematic should work just download and click play.
##What Behaviours i used 
I used a flocking behaviour to create the swarm of drones that was circle the hanger scene 
I used a nev mesh agent to get the pilot to move 
I used a waypoint script that makes the ship move and rotate to different points when it reachs certain waypoints
